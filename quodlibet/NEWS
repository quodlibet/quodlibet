3.1.0 (2014-04-10) - Olden times, man! NEVER LIVE THERE.
--------------------------------------------------------

* Windows is supported again. And it should be in better shape than with 2.6
  in many aspects. Embedded images work now, newer GStreamer with more
  codecs, operon is included etc. The file browser and EF now show the
  favorite folders from the Windows Explorer. The installer will
  now uninstall any existing installation first and as with 2.6.3 there
  is a portable version available.

  There is still an unsolved problem regarding miss-placed context menus
  with multiple monitors [1319].

  Thanks goes to Bakhtiar Hasmanan for providing a working PyGObject stack.

* Initial Wayland support is here (only tested under weston). This was mostly
  fixing weird usage of GTK+ that just happened to work under X11 and not
  using the screen size for calculations since there is no real screen under
  Wayland.

* Piotr Drąg, Rüdiger Arp, Diego Beraldin and Dimitris Papageorgiou worked
  on improving the translations.

* Nick Boultbee worked on a plugin system for playlist plugins and moved
  the duplication/shuffle actions to it. He also moved the rating
  configuration from the plugin into the core.

* Simonas Kazlauskas worked on a plugin system for cover art sources currently
  supporting last.fm and musicbrainz (exposed as two plugins). If active it
  will fetch covers in case no local cover is found. In the future we might
  implement the album art downloader on top of that.

* Thomas Vogt made transparency work again with GTK+3 in the OSD plugin.
  (fake transparency now also works again, which was the last known
  regression from the PyGObject port)

* operon gained new commands (image-extract, image-set, image-clear) for
  manipulating and extracting embedded images for all formats supporting
  embedded images in QL (id3, ogg, flac, wma, mp4). See the manpage [0]
  for examples. There is also a QL plugin which allows removing all
  embedded images and embed the active one. This should get better
  integrated into the tag editor at some point.

* Display patterns now support specifying the markup using square brackets to
  not need escaping in the common case. "\<b\><artist>\</b\>" can now be
  written as "[b]<artist>[/b]" (the old way still works).

* In the radio browser the radio list now contains icecast and shoutcast2
  stations in addition to shoutcast1 ones and only one additional mirror is
  included for each station. QL now shows ~4100 stations of ~30000 we know
  about. Use "Update stations" to get the new list.

Other changes:

* QL now remembers additional open browsers and reopens them on start.
* The main tool bar is better integrated with GTK+ themes.
* We use symbolic icons in many places.
* Added a simple GNOME app menu.
* 'albumartist' is now used for album identification.
* <shift>space enables "stop after the current song".
* Warning before opening too many plugin windows (Nick Boultbee) [1231]
* New --unqueue-all command [1234]

Fixes:

* Config gets saved atomically and handle a corrupted one [1042]
* editing:id3encoding option was ignored [1290]
* album browser: Fix sorting by rating [1352]
* search: Fix results for "&(foo, !bar)" [1327]
* Various crashes caused by code not being ported to PyGObject properly.

Dependencies & Packaging:

* No dependency changes compared to 3.0
* We now install appdata.xml files
* We now install a dbus service file
* ``setup.py build_sphinx`` builds the html user guide
