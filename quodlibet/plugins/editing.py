    The 'filter' function will be called with the tag and proposed value

class EditTagsPlugin(Gtk.Widget):

    The 'tags' attribute is a list of tags this plugin should appear on,
    or false if it should appear for all tags. This must be a class
    attribute, as it is checked before instantiation.

    The 'needs' attribute is a list of tags that must be editable in
    the currently selected songs for the plugin to be sensitive.

    The constructor is called with the tag and value for that row. This
    can be used to set the sensitivity of the menu item, or change its
    text.

    When clicked, the 'activated' function is called on the object,
    again with the tag name and value. It should return a list of
    (tag, value) tuples to replace the previous tag/value with.

    The '_order' attribute decides the sort order of the plugin. The
    default items have orders between 0 and 1. Plugins have order 2.0 by
    default. Plugins with equal orders are sorted by class name.

    How to Handle Submenus
    ----------------------
    If the menu item is given a submenu, magic happens. In particular,
    the callbacks are proxied to the submenu's items, and are attached,
    via connect_object, to make sure activated is called on the original
    item.

    So, to handle submenus,
      1. Make a submenu and attach it to your menu item.2
      2. To each item in the submenu, attach its 'activate' signal to
         something appropriate to prepare the original item's
         activated method,
      3. Because that method will be called after the subitem is
         clicked on, and your activate handler runs.
