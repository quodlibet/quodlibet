Ex Falso / Quod Libet - A Music Library/Editor/Player
========================================================================
Quod Libet is a music management program. It provides several different ways
to view your audio library, as well as support for Internet radio and
audio feeds. It has extremely flexible metadata tag editing and searching
capabilities.

Ex Falso is a tag editor with the same tag editing interface as Quod Libet,
but it does not play files.

Supported file formats include Ogg Vorbis, MP3, FLAC, MOD/XM/IT, Musepack,
Wavpack, and MPEG-4 AAC.

====[ Using EF/QL
To run the programs, use
 $ ./quodlibet.py
or
 $ ./exfalso.py

After installing, you can just run `quodlibet' or `exfalso'.

The manual page contains a brief synopsis of command-line options,
and search and foramtting pattern syntax.
 $ man -l ./man/quodlibet.1

====[ Requirements

==[ Source

Quod Libet depends on the Python runtime and associated libraries.

    * Python (>= 2.6):		http://www.python.org
    * PyGTK (>= 2.16):		http://www.pygtk.org
    * PyGSt (>= 0.10.2):	http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/
    * Mutagen (>= 1.10):
	http://code.google.com/p/quodlibet/wiki/Mutagen

Particular audio formats depend on various GStreamer decoding elements, 
as well as other Python modules. GStreamer splits their downloads into 
good, bad, ugly, and ffmpeg packages; you probably want them all in
order to play as many formats as you can.

Format		Decoder
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASF/WMA		ffmpeg		http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu
FLAC		flacdec		http://flac.sourceforge.net
Musepack	musepackdec	http://www.musepack.net/index.php?pg=src
MOD/XM/IT	modplug		http://modplug-xmms.sourceforge.net/
MP3		mad		http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/
MPEG-4 AAC	faad		http://www.audiocoding.com
SPC700		spcdec		
TrueAudio	ttadec		http://www.trueaudio.com
Ogg Speex	speexdec	http://www.speex.org
Ogg Vorbis	vorbisdec	ttp://www.vorbis.com
Wave		wavparse
WavPack		wavpackdec	http://www.wavpack.com

Internet Radio depends on HTTP support in GStreamer; the most common way 
to get this is to install the GNOME-VFS modules for GStreamer.

Audio Feed support depends on HTTP support and Universal Feed Parser
(http://www.feedparser.org/).

Many parts of Quod Libet benefit from D-Bus and its Python bindings
(http://dbus.freedesktop.org/). iPod support depends on libgpod
and its Python bindings (http://www.gtkpod.org/).

Quod Libet requires intltool, and the Python distutils suite to build and
install. You can do this with
 $ ./setup.py build
 $ ./setup.py install
