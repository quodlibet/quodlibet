Ex Falso / Quod Libet - A Music Library/Editor/Player
========================================================================
Quod Libet is a music management program. It provides several different ways
to view your audio library, as well as support for Internet radio and
audio feeds. It has extremely flexible metadata tag editing and searching
capabilities.

Ex Falso is a tag editor with the same tag editing interface as Quod Libet,
but it does not play files.

Supported file formats include Ogg Vorbis, MP3, FLAC, MOD/XM/IT, Musepack,
and Wavpack.

====[ Requirements

==[ Source

Quod Libet depends on the Python runtime and associated libraries.
 Python (>= 2.3):	http://www.python.org
 PyGTK (>= 2.6):	http://www.pygtk.org
 PyGSt (= 0.8.2):	http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/

All file formats depend on their appropriate GStreamer decoding modules
being available as well as the libraries listed below.
	Ogg Vorbis: 	http://www.andrewchatham.com/pyogg/
	MP3:		http://spacepants.org/src/pymad
	FLAC:		https://www.sacredchao.net/quodlibet/wiki/Download

The following formats all depend on ctypes, available at
http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/, as well as the libraries
listed:
	Musepack:	http://www.musepack.net/index.php?pg=src
	MOD/XM/IT:	http://modplug-xmms.sourceforge.net/#download
	Wavpack:	http://www.wavpack.com/

Internet Radio depends on GNOME-VFS support in GStreamer.

Audio Feed support depends on GNOME-VFS and http://www.feedparser.org/.
