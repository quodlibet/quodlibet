**We believe that you know how to organize your music best.**

Quod Libet is a cross-platform music player that supports the features 
you'd expect from a modern media player, like Unicode support, multimedia 
keys, advanced tag editing and Replay Gain. Quod Libet distinguishes itself 
from other media players with its emphasis on simplicity, performance and 
:ref:`search <Searching>`.

Quod Libet uses `GTK+ <http://www.gtk.org/>`_, because GTK+ makes it easy 
to create clean, simple standards compliant user interfaces.  Quod Libet 
uses `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_, because Python makes it easy to 
create clean, simple functional and object-oriented software. Various other 
packages and libraries add to this - see :ref:`Requirements`.

Using the `Mutagen <http://code.google.com/p/mutagen/>`_ tagging library
keeps the rest of Quod Libet as simple as possible and ensures every
tag in your music library is available for your searching pleasure.
