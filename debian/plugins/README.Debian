How to use Quod Libet plugins
-----------------------------

Quod Libet plugins are all installed in /usr/lib/quodlibet/plugins, such that
they are all picked up by Quod Libet when you start it. You can also put
additional plugins into the ~/.quodlibet/plugins directory.

Plugins are disabled by default. You can enable and configure them by going
to Music > Plugins once Quod Libet has been started.

Enjoy!
