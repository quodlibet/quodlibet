.. _Queue:

The Queue
=========

As described in the :ref:`Overview <Queue_Overview>`, the queue is used to
queue up songs to be played.
In recent versions of Quod Libet,
some new features have been introduced to the queue, which is described below.

Disabling
---------

With release 4.3.0, the *Ignore* and *Keep Songs*
checkboxes were replaced with a *queue disable* button and a *mode selection*
menu.

The queue can be disabled by clicking the padlock in the queue header.
When disabled, the queue will not be played from
- but you can still add songs to it.

Queue Mode Selection
--------------------

The queue also has two different modes that can be selected in its preferences.

In the *Ephemeral* mode (default),
the queue consumes songs as described in the :ref:`Overview <Queue_Overview>`.

The other mode is the *Persistent* mode.
In this mode, songs will be kept in the queue even after being played.
Furthermore, the queue won't have precedence over the song list unless it is
explicitly being played from by first double-clicking on a song in it.
This allows switching between the queue and the song list
without having to clear or disable the queue.
