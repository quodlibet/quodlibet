Frequently Asked Questions
==========================


Why don't all my songs appear in the song list when searching for them?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do you have a global filter in use? Check the *Browsers* tab in *Preferences*.


.. _MetadataLocation:

Where does Quod Libet store all its metadata?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The short answer was originally: in ``~/.quodlibet/``
For newer versions of QL it's more complex:

 * On all platforms, if the ``QUODLIBET_USERDIR`` environment variable is set, this will be used
 * On Windows, it will be in your user's ``AppData`` folder under ``Quod Libet``
   (except portable builds)
 * On OS X, it will be in ``~/.quodlibet/``
 * On Linux / Unix systems:

    * if the ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` environment variable is set,
      ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME/quodlibet/`` will be used
    * else if folder ``~/.config/`` exists, ``~/.config/quodlibet/`` will be used
    * else ``~/.quodlibet/`` will be used still


Under there you'll find all sorts of things,
separate from the audio file tags themselves, e.g.

 * ``songs`` - the pickled songs database.
 * ``config`` - the main Quod Libet configuration file - edit with care
 * ``playlists/`` - a directory for all playlists
 * ``lists/`` - a directory for saved searches and so on
 * ``stations`` / ``stations_all`` - the Internet radio stations lists


Whenever I type a space, Quod Libet pauses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users of some keyboard layouts, including the popular French
Alternative, may hit this bug. In these layouts, the spacebar sends a
non-breaking space character, which GTK+ interprets as
``<control>space``. This is a `known bug in GTK
<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=541466>`__. You can work
around it by changing your keyboard layout to send a regular space.


How do I add custom / unusual tags to the columns in the song list?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Refer to :ref:`editing tags<EditingTags>` if you need to add any custom
   tags.
2. Right-click the song list header bar and select *Customize Headers* from
   the context menu (or click *Preferences* from the main menu and select
   *Song List*)
3. In the *Others* field, click *Edit*, then *Add*, and enter the custom tag
   name, remembering that they are case-sensitive.

Lesser-known (but useful) tags here might include ``~#playcount``,
``~#skipcount``, ``~#bitrate`` or ``~playlists``.


How do I use a different soundcard with Quod Libet?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the chapter on configuring the AudioBackends in the user's guide.


Why does Quod Libet sort my songs out of order?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Music metadata, like music, comes in many languages, and sorting
multi-language text is hard to do. It depends on your language as well
as the text being sorted, and often is still not well-defined.
`Unicode Technical Standard #10 <http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/>`_
outlines an algorithm to sort multi-language text, but even then it
needs ordinal data for each character for each language. We don't know
of any Python implementations of it, and any implementation we use
would have to be fast since we compare thousands of strings when sorting.


I have two albums with the same name which are merged in the Album List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tag them with different ``albumartist`` tags. You can also use
``musicbrainz_albumid`` tags, which several other taggers and our "MusicBrainz
Lookup" plugin can write.


I have two discs of the same album, and they don't get merged in the Album List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure they have the same name (i.e. without "(disc x)" on the end). If
they are still not merged, they have different `albumartist`, `labelid` or
``musicbrainz_albumid`` tags. If they have different label ID tags, delete the
incorrect one. If they have different MusicBrainz album ID tags, add a
``labelid`` tag that is the same for both albums.


Where does Quod Libet store ratings and playcounts?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default these are in the internal database - and remember this is indexed by filename,
so renames will lose data.
For this and other reasons, some users prefer to save save them
*in the tags themselves* (under an email address), using the most appropriate
tag for that format (e.g. `ID3's popm tag <http://id3.org/id3v2.3.0#Popularimeter>`__ for ID3).
See the configuration under
*Preferences* -> *Tags* -> *Save ratings and play _counts in tags*.

Note that some caching is used, so changes aren't written all the time.
Try the *Update Tags In Files* plugins to control this explicitly.


Can I show more than 0 to 4 notes when rating songs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Close Quod Libet; in ``~/.quodlibet/config`` find the ``ratings = 4``
line. Change it to ``ratings = however many ratings you want``. It's
best if the value divides 100 evenly; multiples of 2 and 5 are good.
You will need to use the ratings right-click menu to set ratings above 4.


How can I hide incomplete albums from the Album View?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One way is to enter ``#(tracks > 5)`` into the search box above the
album list - this will only show albums with greater than 5 tracks.


How can I list my tracks based on their ratings?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Right-click somewhere on the headers bar (below the search bar), select
"Track Headers" from the menu and add "Ratings". Now if you click
"Ratings" on the headers bar your tracks will be sorted based on their
ratings.


How is album art handled?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are many ways users like to keep their album art, and Quod Libet
supports graphics (primarily `.jpg` but `.gif` and `.png` also) in these ways:

* Files in the *album* directory with fixed names eg ``folder.jpg``,
  ``cover.jpg``, ``front.png``
* A file containing the ``labelid`` (eg *COCX-32760 cover.jpg*)
* Files of certain other names linked to a
  given album in a shared directory:
  ``<musicbrainz_albumid>.ext`` or ``<artist> - <title>.ext``
* Sub-folders of certain names (``covers/`` or ``<labelid>/``)
  with compatible images in them.
* Embedded cover art in the file itself (incomplete support
  in some formats).

There are fuzzy-matching algorithms to try to determine the most
specific match if multiple of the above exist.

If you're adding new album art, the *Album Art downloader* plugin
allows you to do so easily and is compatible with the above.


Why do songs disappear from my playlists?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is due to the way the library works, and that playlists entries are based
on filename. One of several things might have happened, before a re-scan of
the library (on start-up or otherwise)

* The songs have been renamed, moved, or their directory moved.
  Note this includes using *Rename Files* from the tag editor.
* A removable (mounted) media device - USB disk, network share,
  internet folder or whatever is/was no longer available
  (at the time of refresh).

Note if you're using the Auto Library Update this will happen immediately
(There are ideas to improve this: Issue 961).


Can QL read my ID3 tags encoded in euc-kr / cp1251 / windows-1252 etc?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can define a custom list of encodings to check. UTF-8 is always tried
first, and Latin-1 is always tried last. To make your own list, close QL, open
up ``~/.quodlibet/config``, and find the ``id3encoding`` option. You can enter
any valid encodings here, separated by spaces, and they will be tried in
order. If you have files already imported into your library with incorrect
tags, you'll need to reload them.

Quod Libet saves ID3 tags in UTF-8 or UTF-16.


What does the name mean?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Quodlibet* or *Quod libet* is Latin for "whatever you please" or "whatever
you want", which is the kind of attitude we want to convey with QL: you
control how you fiddle with your music. A *quodlibet* is also a type of
musical composition, an improvisation by several players or vocalists at once,
which is a pretty accurate description of QL's development.

*Ex falso quodlibet*, or "from a falsehood, whatever you please" is one of the
properties of material implication (*if/then*) in classical logics; in
standard notation it can be written as ``∀A (⊥ → A)``.

Finally, the initial directory imported into Subversion was named `ql`,
because I was experimenting with a syntax for a _q_uery _l_anguage.


Where do the release names come from?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Daily Dinosaur Comics <http://www.qwantz.com/>`_ at the time of the release.


I like <my favorite player>, so I won't use Quod Libet!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Okay. We think Quod Libet beats other players in the areas where it counts
(where exactly it does count is undecided; 'tag editing', 'massive libraries',
and 'regexp searching' have all been cited); we didn't like the other players.
If you do, continue using them.
You still might want to check out Ex Falso,
since while there's an awful lot of media players out there,
there are far fewer choices for tag editors.

You could also help us make Quod Libet better!


Changing the volume in Quod Libet changes the main volume!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since version 3.5, Quod Libet will control the PulseAudio stream volume directly (same
as the application slider in ``pavucontrol``) which might have an effect on
the main volume and vice versa. To restore the old behavior disable
``flat-volumes`` mode in PulseAudio. See ``man pulse-daemon.conf`` for more
information.
